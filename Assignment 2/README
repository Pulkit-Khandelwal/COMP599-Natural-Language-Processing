Run the code as
python decipher.py -laplace -lm <cipher_folder>

For example:
python decipher.py -laplace cipher1

Ths will use the laplcae smoothing but not the palin text modelling for cipher1 folder.
decipher.py should be in the same folder as a2data

For plaintext modelling, the data from assignment one is used and is stored in the full_text.txt file.
Place this file in the same directory as the decipher.py file and a2data folder.

That is my current woring directory should contain:
decipher.py, full_text.txt and the folder a2data
