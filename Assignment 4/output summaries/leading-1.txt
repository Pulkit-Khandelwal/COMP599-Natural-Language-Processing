People who can explain how they earned the money and show that taxes were paid can keep it. Currency notes of Rs 1000 and Rs 500 will be just paper with no value7. Five hundred and thousand rupee notes will not be legal tender from midnight. Quite rightly people want to know why more cash wasn't printed in advance; the new notes, obviously, but also the 100 rupee notes, which suddenly became the lifeblood of the economy.
